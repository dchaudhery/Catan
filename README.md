# Settlers of Catan
Settlers of Catan or Catan is a multiplayer board game where players aim to build property from the resources they collect. This game is implemented in C++ and adeptly uses OOP and design patterns. Due to course policy, the code is not public but please send me an email at dchaudhery@uwaterloo.ca for access to the code and UML diagaram. 

The game uses several classes to play including: the Board, BoardTiles, Player, Dice (and its two variants - random and fair), as well as controller functionality and ability to load a previously saved game. 

Here's the implemented board layout:
